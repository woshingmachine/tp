Managing large cohorts with point-and-click workflows is slow, repetitive, and prone to mistakes, especially when student and tutor records must stay consistent. Course Management System (CMS) is built for NUS course coordinators who need speed and accuracy: a command-driven workflow with built-in validation and uniqueness checks that helps you complete routine record tasks in seconds with confidence.

## Quick start

1. Ensure [Java 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html) is installed.
   * Check with: `java --version`

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-F10-2/tp/releases).

1. Create or choose a folder as your CMS home folder (e.g. `C:\Users\<you>\Documents\cms` on Windows).

1. Copy the downloaded jar into that folder.

1. Open a terminal, `cd` into that folder, and run `java -jar cms.jar`.
   A GUI similar to the image below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains sample data.
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press `Enter` to execute it.
   Typing `help` and pressing `Enter` opens the help window.
   Refer to [Command summary](#command-summary) for a quick list of available commands and formats.

1. CMS stores data under the home folder in `data/cms.json`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
To transfer your data to another computer, install CMS there and overwrite the empty `data/cms.json` file it creates with your existing `data/cms.json`.
</div>

## User interface overview

![UI overview](images/Ui.png)

CMS uses a single main window with four working areas:

1. **Command Box**: (Bottom) Enter commands such as `add`, `find`, and `edit`.
2. **Result Display**: (Top) Shows success, error, and guidance messages after each command.
3. **Person List Panel**: (Middle Left) Displays the current list (or filtered list) of students and tutors.
4. **Person Detail Panel**: (Middle Right) Shows details of the currently selected person.

The Help Window is a separate window opened by the `help` command (or `F1`), and displays command guidance plus a User Guide link.

## Features
<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about command format:**<br>

* A command has a command word plus fields.
* Command word: `add`, `edit`, `find`, ...
* Prefixes identify each field, e.g. `n/`, `m/`, `e/`.
* `/` is reserved for prefixes and cannot appear in any field value.
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are values to provide.
* Items in square brackets are optional.
* `...` means the field can be repeated.
* Parameters can be in any order.
* For commands without parameters (`list`, `mask`, `unmask`, `exit`), extra text does not block execution and is reported as ignored.
* e.g. `add n/John Doe m/A0234567X role/tutor soc/johndoe gh/johndoe e/johndoe@u.nus.edu p/91234567 t/01 tag/mentor`

**Field**: A value supplied with a prefix in a command, e.g. `n/John Doe`.

**Prefix**: A marker that indicates what a field means, e.g. `n/`, `m/`, `e/`.

**INDEX**: A 1-based position of a person in the currently displayed list.

**NUS Matric**: Identifier given by NUS in checksum-validated format `A` + 7 digits + a letter (e.g., `A0234567X`) or `U` + 6 digits + a letter (e.g., `U023456W`).

**SoC username**: School of Computing account username stored in the `soc/` field.

**Tutorial group**: Class/tutorial group number in the `t/` field.

**Tag**: Optional label used to categorize a person, e.g. `tag/python`. Could be used for any purpose such as indicating needs, statuses, or grades.

**Help Window**: Separate window that displays help text and a User Guide hyperlink.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the app to a secondary screen and later switch to one screen, the GUI may open off-screen. Delete `preferences.json` before starting again.
2. **If the Help Window is minimized**, triggering help again may keep it minimized, and requires you to manually restore it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Install CMS on the other computer, launch once, then replace the new `data/cms.json` with your old one.

**Q**: Where are my preferences saved?<br>
**A**: Preferences are saved in `preferences.json` in your CMS working directory.

**Q**: Can I undo `delete` or `clear`?<br>
**A**: No. There is currently no undo feature, so keep backups of `data/cms.json` if needed.

**Q**: Why is my `find` command not returning results?<br>
**A**: Check your prefixes and input format (`a/`, `n/`, `m/`), and verify that full-word matching rules are met for name searches.
